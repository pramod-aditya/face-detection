There is an urgent need for improving security in banking region. With the advent
of ATM though banking became a lot easier it even became a lot vulnerable. The chances
of misuse of this much hyped ‘insecure’ baby product (ATM) are manifold due to the
exponential growth of ‘intelligent’ criminals day by day. ATM systems today use no more
than an access card and PIN for identity verification. This situation is unfortunate since
tremendous progress has been made in biometric identification techniques, including
finger printing, facial recognition, and iris scanning.
